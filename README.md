# Threat-Intelligence
## ðŸ“Œ Description

This repository is dedicated to Threat Intelligence (TI) â€” collecting, analyzing, and sharing information about cyber threats to improve detection, prevention, and response. It serves as a resource hub where I document my research, investigations, and automation scripts for threat intelligence operations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of the Project
- Collect and organize Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as malicious IPs, domains, URLs, and file hashes.
- Perform threat actor profiling based on available open-source intelligence (OSINT).
- Automate threat enrichment using APIs (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX, etc.).
- Share case studies and reports on notable threats.
- Build repeatable workflows for SOC & Incident Response teams.
